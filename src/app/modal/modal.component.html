        <h2>Hex Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Players choose a colour and take turns. On each turn one counter is placed in an empty hexagonal cell.
            </li>
            <li>
                Counters may not be moved except with the swap rule.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first player to form a connected path of their counters linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colour wins.
            </li>
            <li>
                The four corner hexagons belong to both adjacent sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Swap rule: on their first move the second player may move normally, or choose to swap their piece with that placed by the first player. [This encourages the first player to only choose a moderately strong first move and so reduces any advantage of going first. Ignore the swap rule for the first few games.]
            </li>
        </ol>
